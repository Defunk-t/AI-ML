# AI-ML

There is no particular aim for this repository beyond educating myself about machine learning, AI, and bio-inspired computing. There are various programs/demos, as well as libraries with my own abstracted implementations.

**Languages used:**

- C++ (CMake)
- Python

**Libraries/frameworks used:**

- TensorFlow

## Programs

- `cl_digits-mnist.py` **(Python, TensorFlow)**  
  From the TensorFlow documentation - handwritten digits classification.

- `cl_fashion-mnist.py` **(Python, TensorFlow)**  
  From the TensorFlow documentation - clothing item classification.

- `cl_movie-reviews.py` **(Python, TensorFlow)**  
  From the TensorFlow documentation - IMDB movie review binary classification. Determining positive or negative sentiment.

- `cl_programming-questions.py` **(Python, TensorFlow)**
  From the TensorFlow documentation - classify questions from Stack Overflow by programming language.

- `ga_string-evolution.cpp` **(C++)**  
  Using a genetic algorithm to evolve a string from randomness to a target string.
